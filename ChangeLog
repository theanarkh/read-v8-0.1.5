2008-08-11: Version 0.1.5 (130240)

        Made the prototype property of functions enumerable.


2008-07-28: Version 0.1.4 (128918)

        Added support for storing JavaScript stack traces in a stack
        allocated buffer to make it visible in shallow core dumps.
        Controlled by the --preallocate-message-memory flag which is
        disabled by default.


2008-07-25: Version 0.1.3 (128832)

        Fixed bug in JSObject::GetPropertyAttributePostInterceptor where
        map transitions would count as properties.

        Allowed aliased eval invocations by treating them as evals in the
        global context. This may change in the future.

        Added support for accessing the last entered context through the
        API and renamed Context::Current to Context::GetCurrent and
        Context::GetSecurityContext to Context::GetCurrentSecurityContext.

        Fixed bug in the debugger that would cause the debugger scripts to
        be recursively loaded and changed all disabling of interrupts to
        be block-structured.

        Made snapshot data read-only to allow it to be more easily shared
        across multiple users of V8 when linked as a shared library.


2008-07-16: Version 0.1.2 (127441)

        Fixed building on Mac OS X by recognizing i386 and friends as
        IA-32 platforms.

        Added propagation of stack overflow exceptions that occur while
        compiling nested functions.

        Improved debugger with support for recursive break points and
        handling of exceptions that occur in the debugger JavaScript code.

        Renamed GetInternal to GetInternalField and SetInternal to
        SetInternalField in the API and moved InternalFieldCount and
        SetInternalFieldCount from FunctionTemplate to ObjectTemplate.


2008-07-09: Version 0.1.1 (126448)

        Fixed bug in stack overflow check code for IA-32 targets where a
        non-tagged value in register eax was pushed to the stack.

        Fixed potential quadratic behavior when converting strings to
        numbers.

        Fixed bug where the return value from Object::SetProperty could
        end up being the property holder instead of the written value.

        Improved debugger support by allowing nested break points and by
        dealing with stack-overflows when compiling functions before
        setting break points in them.


2008-07-03: Version 0.1.0 (125876)

        Initial export.
